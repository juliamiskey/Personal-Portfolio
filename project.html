<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<section>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <p>Going into this project, I understood that in this industry, having a live portfolio is vital because it is your chance
            to showcase the range and level of your talents and abilities. Initially I found creating my own portfolio a challenge,
            because in this unique case I was in charge of everything from content, to design, to development. This project helped
            me understand the scope of what is involved in creating websites, and it also gave me more experience in following
            a creative as well as technical process to ensure my work was organized and efficient. Considering that throughout
            the process of making the website I changed my ideas so often, I believe the design I was finally able to settle
            on (which is what you see here), will probably be different eventually anyways. This page is where I am able to describe
            my process and explain the design and development showcased on the website.</p>

<!-- THE PROCESS -->
<section>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>For my portfolio I started with a content list to organize what I wanted to showcase as well as any writing I would need to provide. From there I created rough wireframes to give me an idea of the layout of what was going on my site.Because I was working by myself I did not need to go through as many formal steps during the initial phase of brainstorming,
        however by creating these lists and mapping out what I needed I felt much more organized and was able to prioritize
        tasks more efficiantly.</p>

<!-- THE DESIGN -->
<section class="design">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>The Design</h2>
        <p>I wanted to make my website colourful, while maintaining a bright and minimal feeling at the same time. I was also hoping
            to create a design that would reflect my own personal style. By using playful and bold fonts, combined with a soft,
            yet bright colour scheme, I was able to create a look that I believe represents my fun but quiet personality.
        </p>

        <h3>Colours</h3>
        <div class="colors port">
            <div class="color one"></div>
            <div class="color two"></div>
            <div class="color three"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="fonts port">
            <h3>Fonts</h3>

            <p>
                <span class="fontone">Playfair Display</span>
                <span class="lighttext">display heading</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="fonttwo">Montserrat</span>
                <span class="lighttext">main heading</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="fontthree">Lato</span>
                <span class="lighttext">body text</span>
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

<!-- THE DEVELOPMENT -->
<section>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>The Development</h2>
        <p>The development process for my portfolio was quite simple because the design did not involve much JavaScript, and the
        website was static so I was not required to build any templates using PHP. I still wanted to incorperate some small
        JavaScript and CSS animations, so I added a scroll function in JS to make the text fade in when that part of the
        webpage was visible, as well as some very subtle CSS animations throughout the landing page. I also installed a filter
        gallery using a JS Isotope plugin to categorize my projects on my work section.</p>

<!-- THE RESULT -->
<section>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>The Result</h2>
        <p>Overall I was able to accomplish my goal of creating a minimal, bright, and colorful portfolio website. I found that
        although not everything worked out the way I wanted it to, this project was still an amazing way for me to learn
        more about the web design process and gain familiarity with the various tools needed.
        <br> If I were to go through the same project again, there are a few things I would probably do differently. For example,
        I built the website using simply HTML, but next time I would use PHP in order to maintain some consistency and organization
        to my files rather than having several repeating fields. I also would have spent more time checking the quality of
        the content, before putting so much effort into the design and development. That way I would have a stronger foundation
        when actually building the website.</p>
